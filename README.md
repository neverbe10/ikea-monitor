IKEA Click & Collect Availability website source code

This is a fun project for myself to get used to web development again after 5 years of absence. I started from a script and didn't have a chance to redesign everything, so the codebase is still very dirty.

For new devleopers who want to learn about web scraping, some code in this project shows a good example. However, please keep in mind that the current structure of the codebase is not a good example in terms of software engineering.

For coders who want to contribute, please join the discord server [here](https://discord.gg/csjgU5V).
